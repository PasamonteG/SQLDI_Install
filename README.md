# Colliding Worlds
documentation repository for colliding worlds workshops

Colliding Worlds is a collection of practical examples of using a z/OS environment to deploy and use AI technologies with z/OS.

## IBM Z16 Context
The IBM Z16 introduced the Telum processor, with the AIU processing unit to support AI workloads.
z/OS has also provided a wide range of AI software support, both proprietary and open source, to enable AI workloads.
A Z16-based infrastructure is required to realise the business benefits of AI at Scale.
However, a low-cost emulated IBM Z environment is all you need to learn how to deploy AI on Z.

## Colliding Worlds Environment
The Colliding Worlds workshop makes use of ZD&T ( Z Development and Test ) to provide a z/OS environment for gaining practical experiences of various AI on Z deployment scenarios. This github repository contains the hands-on learning guides for a student to perform the exercises. It also contains an audit trail of all the work that was done to prepare the lab environment.

Hands-On Learning exercises are provided for two categories of experience.

* Using AI on Z - aimed at the IT and Data Science users. (ie after the software environment has been built)
* Deploying AI software on Z - aimed at the IT specialists who will have to deploy all the software.

You will need to request the correct ZVA Image for the exercises you wish to do.

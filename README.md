# IBM SQL Data Insights Installation Lab
IBM z16 and also IBM z17brings together the worlds of Enterprise-Scale Transaction Workloads, with Machine Learning and AI.

Through this lab we will introduce you in the installation and setup of the IBM SQL Data Insights for Db2 v13 (SDI). It is a feature that you can download and install, and any other Db2 for z/OS feature, using its FMID. With SDI you will enable business analysts and data scientists to use a powerful AI tool that comes with your Db2 for z/OS, just by using SQL sentences.

## IBM Z Context
The IBM z16 introduced the Telum processor, with the AIU processing unit to support AI workloads. IBM z17 has continued with enabling AI acceleration with Telum II and its enhanced AIU.
z/OS has also provided a wide range of AI software support, both proprietary and open source, to enable AI workloads, that IBM is supporting and providing in several different packages: installable software, isolated containers, K8S in Openshift and others. 

... However, a low-cost emulated IBM Z environment is all you need to learn how to deploy and use AI on Z.

## IBM's ZVA Environment
In this workshop workshop we will make use of ZD&T ( Z Development and Test ) to provide a z/OS environment for gaining practical experiences of SDI. This github repository contains the hands-on learning guides for a student to perform the exercises. It also contains an audit trail of all the work that was done to prepare the lab environment.

**<TO BE REVIEWED**

Hands-On Learning exercises are provided for two categories of experience.

* Using AI on Z - aimed at the IT and Data Science users. (ie after the software environment has been built)
* Deploying AI software on Z - aimed at the IT specialists who will have to deploy all the software.

You will need to request the correct ZVA Image for the exercises you wish to do.


The links below will take you to the exercise notebooks for the experiences you wish to make use of.

# Colliding Worlds
documentation repository for colliding worlds workshops

Colliding Worlds is a collection of practical examples of using a z/OS environment to deploy and use AI technologies with z/OS.

## IBM Z16 Context
The IBM Z16 introduced the Telum processor, with the AIU processing unit to support AI workloads.
z/OS has also provided a wide range of AI software support, both proprietary and open source, to enable AI workloads.
A Z16-based infrastructure is required to realise the business benefits of AI at Scale.
However, a low-cost emulated IBM Z environment is all you need to learn how to deploy AI on Z.

## Colliding Worlds Environment
The Colliding Worlds workshop makes use of ZD&T ( Z Development and Test ) to provide a z/OS environment for gaining practical experiences of various AI on Z deployment scenarios. This github repository contains the hands-on learning guides for a student to perform the exercises. It also contains an audit trail of all the work that was done to prepare the lab environment.

Hands-On Learning exercises are provided for two categories of experience.

* Using AI on Z - aimed at the IT and Data Science users. (ie after the software environment has been built)
* Deploying AI software on Z - aimed at the IT specialists who will have to deploy all the software.

The links below will take you to the exercise notebooks for the experiences you wish to make use of.

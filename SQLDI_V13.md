# SQL Data Insights Feature of Db2 V13

SQL Data Insights is a standard feature of Db2 V13, that provides AI-enabled queries. 
This document provides a step-by-step worked example of how to deploy it and use it.
The worked example is based on a z/OS V2.5 system image that IBM can provision for clients for demonstrations and skills transfer.
However, this document is written in a generic way, so that it can be helpful to clients deploying SQLDI in their own systems.

**Note** This document is a worked example, written as a simple "getting started" scenario. It should be used in conjunction with the official Db2 z/OS product documentation, which is referenced at the end of this document.

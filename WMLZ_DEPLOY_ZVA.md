# Deploying WMLZ V2.4 on ZVA

Watson Machine Learing for z/OS (WMLZ) is IBM's premiere product for supporting the AI lifecycle of machine learning and deep learning models on z/OS.
WMLZ deploymemt is mostly implemented with Uniz System Services (USS) within z/OS.
This document provides a step-by-step worked example of how to deploy it and use it.
The worked example is based on a z/OS V2.5 system image that IBM can provision for clients for demonstrations and skills transfer.
However, this document is written in a generic way, so that it can be helpful to clients deploying WMLZ in their own systems.

**Note** This document is a worked example, written as a simple "getting started" scenario. It should be used in conjunction with the official WMLZ product documentation, which is localed [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/wml-for-zos/2.4.0).

## Two Documents

There are two documents covering WMLZ V2.4

1. ***This*** document, the WMLZ Deployment document, which is an audit trail of how to deploy WMLZ V2.4
2. The [Lab_Exercises](https://github.com/zeditor01/collidingworlds/blob/main/WMLZ_Lab_Exercises.md) document, which should be used in conjunction with the ZVA-provisioned image for taking a WMLZ test drive.

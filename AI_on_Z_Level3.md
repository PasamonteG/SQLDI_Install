## 1. Objectives and Scope of this workbook

This workbook is a companion intended for use with the Test Drive System for AI Solutions on z/OS available at 'Z Virtual Access' (ZVA)

* The ZVA image includes a range of Data and AI software on z/OS, prepared and ready for a test drive.
* This workbook is a guided tour for using that software to progress through an AI lifecycle process. (Data analysis, Model Training, Deploying Scoring Models, and Calling the Models from OLTP environments).

The objective is to provide practical insight into deploying AI solutions on the IBM Z platform, using a worked example that is documented in this workbook.

A sister workbook is also available to allow practitioners to rehearse the deployment of the software, to gain experience in the deployment processes before performing a deployment in a customer environment.
